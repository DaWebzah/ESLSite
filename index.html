                    <div class="pix"></div>
                    <p>If you are able to follow my writing here, chances are that you have spent several years going through various schools and courses, but still can’t fully understand, let alone fluently speak English.</p>
                    <p>And every time you listen to a real conversation between native English speakers - you can barely understand anything at all.</p>
                    <p>There are many reasons why these problems are so common, but most often it is the difference between written and spoken English (in its native form) and/or teachers' inability to point it out.</p>
                    <p>I can help you overcome this problem, take it to a whole new level and improve your overall English speaking and understanding.</p>

                    <h2>customized lesson approach</h2>
                    <div class="pix" id="how"></div>
                    <p>No "miracle methodology" here. No pills to take, no tapes to listen to while you sleep, and no expensive books &amp; materials to buy.</p>
                    <p>I custom design lessons to fit not only your learning needs, but more importantly – your interests.</p>
                    <p>Why?</p>
                    <p>Simply because, when you like the topic, you are eager to learn about it and discuss it. With custom lessons based on your interests you learn faster and retain what you learn longer. In example, let’s say you need a lot of work with grammar and like cars (a lot!). Then I would put together a lesson, or a series of lessons, based on exciting automotive topics/news and work in the grammar exercises you need.</p>
                    <p>My lessons are not rigid and no topic’s a taboo. We might start a class with one topic and finish with another – whatever keeps you engaged in conversation/discussion.</p>

                    <p>Whether we like it or not, globalization has picked its language a long time ago.</p>
                    <p>Thus, being able to speak and understand business English is an absolute prerequisite to any career advancement in the corporate world of today, regardless of your location.</p>
                    <p>I spent over 10 years working in ‘corporate America’ and a great deal of that time teaching specialty software usage for the insurance industry, and actually used ‘Business English’ on everyday basis.</p>
                    <p>Before moving to Florianopolis, I taught Business English in-company and out of my private office in Sao Paulo for four years. During this time, I designed many lessons detailed to the industry specific (e.g. financial, automotive, marketing, etc.) terminology.</p>

                    <p>All aviation professionals in Brazil are well aware of the importance of communicating in English.</p>
                    <p>In 2008, ANAC started mandatory English Proficiency Testing for pilots and air traffic controllers.</p>
                    <p>I can help you achieve and maintain (minimum) ICAO level 4 language proficiency requirements and prepare you for the testing.</p>
                    <p>I am a holder of an FAA Commercial Pilot’s License since 1994, instrument rated, with over 500 hours of flight time. Before moving to Florianopolis, I spent three years teaching Aviation English and Radiotelephony at Congonhas Airport and out of my private office in Sao Paulo.</p>

                    <h2>frequently asked questions</h2>
                    <h3>Do you use any particular course material and/or books?</h3>
                    <p>No, but I occasionally reach into them while I’m creating lessons, as I usually gather the content from various sources on the internet and in printed media. However, you don’t need to purchase any books/materials. I email you the lesson beforehand, so that you can pre-read and print it.</p>
                    <h3>I already have some books/materials. Can I use them?</h3>
                    <p>Sure, no problem. I can work with you off of your book and help you understand it fully, while adding additional material as per your need.</p>
                    <h3>How much do you charge?</h3>
                    <p>As far as the pricing goes, I am flexible. It really depends on what you need and want, therefore the best way to determine that is to meet in person for consultation/assessment (free, no charge) and discuss it over a cup of coffee.</p>
